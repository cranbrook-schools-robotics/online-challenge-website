			<h3><b>CKRobotics</b></h3>

			<p>The Cranbrook/Kingswoood robotics program is an extracurricular activity offered to students from First grade through Twelfth grade.  It is a collaborative effort on the part of students, parents, teachers, mentors, coaches and supportive volunteers.  CKrobotics upper school students play an integral role in the development and growth of the entire program through direct classroom and lab session volunteering and mentorship roles in the lower elementary, upper elementary and middle school robotics environments.</p>
			<p>Lower Elementary School students engage in introductory after school robotics enrichment classes offered throughout the school year which teach the fundamentals of building and simple coding techniques.</p>
			<p>Upper elementary school students are introduced to Vex IQ through weekly instructional classes and are exposed to competitive robotics through their participate in Vex IQ elementary school only tournaments as well as blended events.  Most teams have a chance to compete in three to five competitive qualifying events per season and some may earn a spot to compete in VEX IQ ES Michigan State Championships as well as the VEX IQ ES World competition.</p> 
			<p>Sixth and seventh grade middle school students participate in regular weekly VEX IQ lab sessions on Sundays as well as additional tournament preparation sessions during the week to prepare for upcoming tournaments.  Each CKrobotics Vex IQ team has the opportunity to compete in six to eight qualifying tournaments per season with a chance to advance to the VEX IQ MS State as well as VEX IQ MS World Competitions.</p>
			<p>There are approximately 150 students participating in robotics at Cranbrook this year. For the 2017-2018 competitive season, CKrobotics consists of twenty-four actively competitive teams:  4 VEX IQ ES teams, 9 VEX IQ MS teams, 3 VRC MS teams, and 8 VRC HS teams.</p>
			<h5>Current standings are as follows:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>One out of four VEX IQ ES teams qualified for States</li>
				<li>Seven out of 9 VEX IQ MS teams qualified for States</li>
				<li>Two out of three VRC MS teams qualified for Eastern Michigan Regionals</li>
				<li>Eight out of eight VRC HS teams qualified for Eastern Michigan Regionals</li>

			<h3><b>SMC</b></h3>

			<p>The Student Management Corps (SMC) is the leadership team for the robotics club. Each member has their own individual specialty and assignments, but they all together weigh in on issues and decide the course of action for the club. The members of the SMC attend weekly lunch meetings to discuss the state of the club, report their progress, and offer up ideas for how to make the club more effective. The SMC is a unique opportunity for students to have a voice in the administration of the club, and the opportunity to be in a leadership position.</p>

			<h3><b>Website Team</b></h3>

			<p>The Website Team was tasked with the creation of this website for the online website competition. Led by the Chief Software and Hardware Engineers Chase Norman and Steven Wang, the team built the website from the ground up, with handwritten HTML. Bootstrap was used to help with the CSS formatting. Everybody on the team has experience in HTML, and did their part to bring the site to completion. This website is mobile friendly, and has all of the information that students, parents, and teachers need.</p>
