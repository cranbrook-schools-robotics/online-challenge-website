			<h3><b>SMC</b></h3>

			<p>The Student Management Corps (SMC) is the leadership team for the robotics club. Each member has their own individual specialty and assignments, but they all together weigh in on issues and decide the course of action for the club. The members of the SMC attend weekly lunch meetings to discuss the state of the club, report their progress, and offer up ideas for how to make the club more effective. The SMC is a unique opportunity for students to have a voice in the administration of the club, and the opportunity to be in a leadership position.</p>

			<h3><b>Website Team</b></h3>

			<p>The Website Team was tasked with the creation of this website for the online website competition. Led by the Chief Software and Hardware Engineers Chase Norman and Steven Wang, the team built the website from the ground up, with handwritten HTML. Bootstrap was used to help with the CSS formatting. Everybody on the team has experience in HTML, and did their part to bring the site to completion. This website is mobile friendly, and has all of the information that students, parents, and teachers need.</p>
